# Analysis Report

Using this dataset we are able to create a model that will test loan risks from lenders to borrowers.

-The accuracy of the model is 99% accurate
-The percision is 84% accurate. Definitally need some work but is useable
-the recall is 94% accurate 

Having the accuracy of the model be 99% in itself makes this a pretty reliable model but with the recall so high and the percision being 84%.
This is a very good model for finding out about possible loan risks.
